  <h1>About This Project</h1>

  <p>
    This project was developed as part of a student-led innovation challenge focused on building real-world tech solutions. It reflects our belief that small, practical tools can make a big difference in everyday life — whether in schools, communities, or cities.
  </p>

  <p>
    The application aims to simplify how people report issues, share concerns, or make requests — all in a fast, accessible, and mobile-friendly way. Though built with students in mind, its design allows it to scale for use in neighborhoods, local businesses, or even municipal services.
  </p>

  <p>
    From mobile responsiveness to data handling, every feature was built during the event with a strong focus on usability, privacy, and real-world need. Our goal was to not just build an app, but to create a foundation for community-driven digital improvement.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is just the beginning — we see potential for future versions to support things like image recognition, multilingual support, and AI-powered analysis. The project stands as a contribution to local innovation, aiming to make technology more helpful, one tool at a time.
